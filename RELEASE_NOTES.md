# chem-kumo 1.1.0 — release notes

This release adds the installable `kumo` command-line tool and molecular-orbital
reconstruction from Gaussian FCHK coefficients. The CLI supports 1-based MO
indices, inclusive ranges, HOMO/LUMO selectors, and alpha/beta channels.
Existing ground-state SCF density functionality is unchanged.

The 25-test development suite passed on macOS ARM64, including ten Gaussian
Cubegen orbital-amplitude comparisons and restricted/unrestricted CLI listing
checks. This release adds an end-to-end CLI regression test for density and
orbital Cube generation and extends the installed-consumer check to cover the
installed CLI. These additions must be validated on the final release package.

The numerical core is unchanged from the validated 1.1.0 development baseline.
Dependencies remain C++20 and Eigen, with Meson as the build system.
